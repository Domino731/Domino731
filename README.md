### Hi there 👋, I am Dominik
---
I am a young aspiring developer who is not afraid of challenges and puts self-development and passion on the first place. Im looking for my first job or intership as junior react developer.

My adventure with programming began at the age of 14 when I started attending to classes about programming robots  with lego bricks (mindstorms). Together with my friends we created everything we wanted, we even created a programmed robot that cleaned ping pong balls.  In the winter of 2021 I decided to return to what I love, which is programming, a world where everything is possible.

I'm a react front-end developer for websites but I aspire to be a full-stack developer in order to have the power to create entire websites myself. When I program I always have 3 thoughts in my head: full automation, clean and clear code and optimization for the website. However, it's the automation of tasks that gives me the most and I'm fulfilled when I know that in order to add a new element to the page I just need to pass a new data object. When I create a new project I always try to make it different from the previous ones and introduce new technologies. 

In May 2021 I graduated from Coders Lab programming bootcamp which gave me a solid foundation for further development. I programming  all the time because I know that with hard work I will achieve my dream goal of creating my own Facebook.

 I enjoy riding dirt bikes and in the next year I plan to start competition with others. I love the world of technology and I can talk about it for hours, also interested in space, gym, games and memes :)
 
 Currently working on my most ambitious project 'Infninite_stack' which will be my own Stack Overflow,. It will serve as a second home for developer. This project will be have a panel where a developer can plan his project, its steps, its progress. The most innovative thing will be the webpack configurator section. If you wanna be part of this project 😀, write on d.orzechowski18@gmail.com.
